# VBA-challenge
For this challenge, I created a single VBA file that loops through all the stocks for a single year while outputting:
  - Each ticker symbol
  - The yearly change for that ticker (formatted to show red/green for negative/positive changes)
  - The percent change of that ticker for the year
  - The total stock volume for the year

It also outputs in a seperate section:
  - Greatest % Increase
  - Greatest % Decrease
  - Greatest Total Volume
